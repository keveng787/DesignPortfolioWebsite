          For this travel app project, I was tasked to design a service aimed at young, adventurous
          travelers, primarily college students and recent graduates.

          Research
        </h3>
        <p>
          The project began with in-depth
          research into competitors like Lonely Planet, Footprint, and Let’s Go, to understand how to
          appeal to a budget-conscious, experience-focused audience.

      </div>
      <p>
        After anaylyzing the competition, I decided I wanted a clean and minimalistic UI, with a focus on
        the unique travel locations offered by my app.

          Low-Fidelity Prototype
        </h3>
        <p>
          After figuring out my goals for the app, I sketched out my ideas for the app, experiementing with
          different layouts and experiences.

        <h3>
          Style Guide
        </h3>
        <p>
          Before jumping to the final prototype, I created a style guide for my app's
          brand identity. I wanted to emphasize how my app provides an escape for students overwhelmed by
          school and work. I created a color pallete and picked fonts that provided a sense of calm.

        <img src="/images/travel-page-images/Research1.jpg" alt="">
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          With the style guide created, I was able to create a cohesive look for my high fidelity prototypes.

        <h3>
          Final Project
        </h3>
        <p>
          The prototype features many interactive elements and animations using custom
          Figma components and variables. I culminated the project with a pitch, emphasizing the app's ease of use,
          alignment with the brand, and its appeal to a younger audience seeking memorable and unique adventures.

        <h1>Takeaways</h1>
        <p>
          This app was my first major design project, exposing me to the principles of 
          interaction and experience design. I learned a tremendous amout wireframing, research, iteration, 
          and tools like Figma and photoshop. This project made me realize just how much work and effort is needed
          to create a smooth and pleasent digital user experience.
